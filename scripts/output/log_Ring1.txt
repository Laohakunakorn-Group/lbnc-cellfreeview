Dark subtraction using bright and dark ROIs:
Bright ROI = 129x151 px
Dark ROI = 140x260 px
Dilution calibration results
Reference image: 0
Offset: 1

We expect a dilution function of cn/c0=(1-VD/VT)**N.
The linearisation is therefore Z*log(f)=log(cn/c0)=N*log(1-VD/VT).

WLS fitting to y=a+bx yields the dilution ratio VD/VT.
The values of a and b are equal to
a =0.0029
b =-0.2941

The standard errors are given by
sa =0.0659
sb =0.0454

The 95 percent confidence boundaries are given by
ksa =0.1558
ksb =0.1073

The linear correlation coefficient of the fit is
r =-0.9989

The dilution ratio VD/VT is: 0.255 +/- 0.034 (+/- 0.080)
where the 95 percent confidence interval is given in brackets

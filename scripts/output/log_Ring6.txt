Dark subtraction using bright and dark ROIs:
Bright ROI = 129x151 px
Dark ROI = 140x260 px
Dilution calibration results
Reference image: 0
Offset: 1

We expect a dilution function of cn/c0=(1-VD/VT)**N.
The linearisation is therefore Z*log(f)=log(cn/c0)=N*log(1-VD/VT).

WLS fitting to y=a+bx yields the dilution ratio VD/VT.
The values of a and b are equal to
a =-0.0024
b =-0.3674

The standard errors are given by
sa =0.0617
sb =0.0549

The 95 percent confidence boundaries are given by
ksa =0.1458
ksb =0.1298

The linear correlation coefficient of the fit is
r =-0.9988

The dilution ratio VD/VT is: 0.307 +/- 0.038 (+/- 0.090)
where the 95 percent confidence interval is given in brackets
